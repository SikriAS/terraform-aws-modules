= Running services on-prem

This example shows how to run a service on premises.

A prerequisite for running with ECS Anywhere, is to already have an ECS Anywhere agent set up.
To learn more about that, check out link:https://github.com/nsbno/terraform-aws-ecs-anywhere-instance[`terraform-aws-ecs-anywhere-instance`]!

Please remember that ECS Anywhere limits networking and load-balancing posibilities.
Check out link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-anywhere.html#ecs-anywhere-considerations[the AWS docs] to learn more about that.
